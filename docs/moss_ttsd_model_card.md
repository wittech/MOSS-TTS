# MOSS-TTSD

**MOSS-TTSD** is a long-form spoken dialogue generation model that enables highly expressive multi-party conversational speech synthesis across multiple languages. It supports continuous long-duration generation, flexible multi-speaker dialogue control, and state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning with only short reference audio. MOSS-TTSD is designed for real-world long-form content creation, including podcasts, audiobook, sports and esports commentary, dubbing, crosstalk, and entertainment scenarios.


## 1. Overview

### 1.1 TTS Family Positioning
MOSS-TTSD is the Long-Form Dialogue Specialist in our open-source TTS Family. While our foundational models focus on high-fidelity single-speaker synthesis, MOSS-TTSD extends this capability into the realm of complex, multi-party interactions. It is designed to bridge the gap between distinct audio samples and cohesive, continuous conversation.

**Design Goals**
- **Authentic Interaction**: Capturing the natural rhythm, overlaps, and dynamics of human conversation.
- **Sustained Coherence**: Maintaining speaker identity and contextual consistency over extended durations (up to 1 hour).
- **Production Adaptability**: Serving diverse high-end scenarios from rigorous audiobook narration to dynamic sports commentary.

### 1.2 Key Capabilities
MOSS-TTSD transforms static text into living conversations, offering features specifically optimized for multi-speaker environments:

- **Multi-Party Conversational Generation** — Unlike traditional TTS which optimizes for reading, MOSS-TTSD masters the rhythm of conversation. It supports 1 to 5 speakers with flexible control, handling natural turn-taking, overlapping speech patterns, and distinct persona maintenance.

- **Extreme Long-Context Modeling** — Moving beyond short-sentence generation, the model is architected for stability over long durations, supporting up to 60 minutes of coherent audio in a single session without losing speaker identity or prosodic quality.

- **Diverse Scenario Adaptation** — The model is fine-tuned on high-variability scenarios to handle different speaking styles:
  - Conversational Media: AI Podcasts, Interviews.
  - Dynamic Commentary: High-energy Sports/Esports shouting and analysis.
  - Entertainment: Audiobooks (narrator + characters), Dubbing, and Crosstalk (Xiangsheng).

- **Multilingual & Zero-Shot Cloning** — Features state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning requiring only short reference audio (3-10s), with robust cross-lingual performance across major languages including Chinese, English, Japanese, and European languages.

### 1.3 Model Architecture

MOSS-TTSD is built on top of **Delay Pattern (MossTTSDelay)** from our MOSS-TTS foundation model — a single Transformer backbone with multi-head parallel prediction using delay scheduling for multi-codebook audio tokens. 

For full architecture details, see **`moss_tts_delay/README.md`**.

## 2. Quick Start

MOSS-TTSD uses a **continuation** workflow: provide reference audio for each speaker, their transcripts as a prefix, and the dialogue text to generate. The model continues in each speaker's identity.

### Subjective Evaluation
For open-source models, annotators are asked to score each sample pair in terms of speaker attribution accuracy, voice similarity, prosody, and overall quality. Following the methodology of the LMSYS Chatbot Arena, we compute Elo ratings and confidence intervals for each dimension.
![alt text](../assets/VS_Open-Source_Models.jpg)

For closed-source models, annotators are only asked to choose the overall preferred one in each pair, and we compute the win rate accordingly.
